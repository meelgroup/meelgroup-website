<h1>Post-Doctoral, PhD, and Research Assistant Positions for Provably Verified and Explainable Probabilistic Reasoning</h1> 
<p style="margin-left:0%; margin-right:40%;">

Multiple post-doctoral, PhD, and research assistant positions available in the project on "Provably Verified and
Explainable Probabilistic Reasoning," led by the Principle Investigator, <a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~meel/index.html">Kuldeep S. Meel</a>. 
The positions are funded by the 2.5 million dollar NRF Fellowship for AI awarded to PI and additional funding from <a href="https://www.dso.org.sg/">Defense Service Organization, Singapore</a>. <br> <br>
 
The project broadly aims to develop of formal
methods for AI techniques and employ advances in AI techniques
for the development of formal methods. 
The project is sub-divided into the following four major themes whose detailed
description is available
at <a href="https://meelgroup.github.io/#research">MeelGroup Research. </a> <br><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-left:1.5%; margin-right:40%;">
Theme 1: AI for Formal Methods: New Paradigms for SAT, MaxSAT, and Functional Synthesis<br><br>

Theme 2: Constrained Sampling and 
Integration/Counting<br><br>

Theme 3: Formal Methods for AI: Verification and Testing of AI Systems<br><br>

Theme 4: Logic for AI: Interpretable Models and Semantically Aware Deep Neural Networks <br><br>

<h3>Job Requirements:</h3><br>
<p style="margin-left:1.5%; margin-right:40%;">
1. A Ph.D. in CS or related disciplines such as ECE, Mathematics, and OR.<br>
2. Prior publications with deep algorithmic or system contribution in top-tier conferences <br>
3. We work at the intersection of algorithmic design and systems; 
therefore, an ideal candidate should have deeper expertise in one area 
and willingness to learn the other. A strong background in statistics, 
algorithms/formal methods and prior experience in coding are crucial to 
make a significant contribution to our research.

<h3>Procedure for post-doc positions</h3><br>
<p style="margin-left:1.5%; margin-right:40%;">
Interested candidates should
email <a href="mailto:meel+postdoc@comp.nus.edu.sg">meel+postdoc@comp.nus.edu.sg</a>
with a PDF of CV, which must contain information of at least two
references.  Furthermore, a short write up indicating your interest in
a particular theme is required. <br>
The initial term of appointment will be one year extensible for another 
year, upon review of satisfactory performance.<br>
The selected candidates will be offered competitive salaries and benefits including generous travel funding to top-tier conferences.<br>
