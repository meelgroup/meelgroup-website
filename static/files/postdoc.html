<h1>Post-Doctoral Positions for Provably Verified and Explainable Probabilistic Reasoning</h2> 
<p style="margin-left:0%; margin-right:40%;">

Multiple post-doctoral
research positions available in the project on "Provably Verified and
Explainable Probabilistic Reasoning," led by the Principle Investigator, <a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~meel/index.html">Kuldeep S. Meel</a>. The positions supported in part by the multi-million dollar NRF Fellowship for AI awarded to PI and additional funding from <a href="https://www.dso.org.sg/">Defense Service Organization, Singapore</a>. <br>
 
The project broadly aims to develop of formal
methods for AI techniques and employ advances in AI techniques
for the development of formal methods. <br>
  
The project is sub-divided into the following four major themes whose detailed
description is available
at <a href="https://meelgroup.github.io/#research">MeelGroup Research. </a> <br><br>
</p>
<p style="margin-left:1.5%; margin-right:40%;">
Theme 1: Revisiting NP Revolution: New Paradigms for SAT/SMT/MaxSAT Solvers<br><br>

Theme 2: Beyond NP Revolution: Constrained Sampling and 
Integration/Counting<br><br>

Theme 3: Verification of AI Systems<br><br>

Theme 4: Interpretable and Explainable Explanations for AI Systems<br><br>

<h3>Job Requirements:</h3><br>
<p style="margin-left:1.5%; margin-right:40%;">
1. A Ph.D. in CS or related disciplines such as ECE, Mathematics, and OR.<br>
2. Prior publications with deep algorithmic or system contribution in top-tier conferences <br><br>
3. We work at the intersection of algorithmic design and systems; 
therefore, an ideal candidate should have deeper expertise in one area 
and willingness to learn the other. A strong background in statistics, 
algorithms/formal methods and prior experience in coding are crucial to 
make a significant contribution to our research.
