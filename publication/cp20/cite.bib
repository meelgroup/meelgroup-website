abstract={The study of phase transition behaviour in SAT has led to deeper understanding and algorithmic improvements in modern SAT solvers. Motivated by these prior studies of phase transitions in SAT, we seek to study the behaviour of size and compile-time behaviour for random k-CNF formulas in the context of knowledge compilation.},
