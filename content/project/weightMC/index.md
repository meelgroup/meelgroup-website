WeightMC is hashing-based algorithm for weighted counting (discrete integration) over Boolean domains. It takes a CNF formula and weight function as inputs and returns weighted count. In contrast to previous attempts to develop weighted counting that rely on use of Optimization oracles, WeightMC only uses feasibility oracle. A simple reworking of this algorithm was used by Belle et al to predicate delays in UK transportation network.
