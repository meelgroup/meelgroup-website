abstract: 'Uniform sampling has drawn diverse applications in programming languages
  and software engineering, like in constrained-random verification (CRV), constrained-fuzzing
  and bug synthesis. The effectiveness of these applications depend on the uniformity
  of test stimuli generated from a given set of constraints. Despite significant progress
  over the past few years, the performance of the state of the art techniques still
  falls short of those of heuristic methods employed in the industry which sacrifice
  either uniformity or scalability when generating stimuli. In this paper, we propose
  a new approach to the uniform generation that builds on recent progress in knowledge
  compilation. The primary contribution of this paper is marrying knowledge compilation
  with uniform sampling: our algorithm, KUS, employs the state-of-the-art knowledge
  compilers to first compile constraints into d-DNNF form, and then, generates samples
  by making two passes over the compiled representation. We show that KUS is able
  to significantly outperform existing state-of-the-art algorithms, SPUR and UniGen2,
  by up to 3 orders of magnitude in terms of runtime while achieving a geometric speedup
  of 1.7 and 8.3 over SPUR and UniGen2 respectively. Also, KUS achieves a lower PAR-2
  score, around 0.82x that of SPUR and 0.38x that of UniGen2. Furthermore, KUS achieves
  speedups of up to 3 orders of magnitude for incremental sampling. The distribution
  generated by KUS is statistically indistinguishable from that generated by an ideal
  uniform sampler. Moreover, KUS is almost oblivious to the number of samples requested.'
