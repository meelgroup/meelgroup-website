abstract: "The rise of highly configurable complex software and its widespread usage requires design of efficient testing methodology. t-wise coverage is a leading metric to measure the quality of the testing suite and the underlying test generation engine. While uniform samplingbased test generation is widely believed to be the state of the art approach to achieve t-wise coverage in presence of constraints on the set of configurations, such a scheme often fails to achieve high t-wise coverage in presence of complex constraints. In this work, we propose a novel approach Baital, based on adaptive weighted sampling using literal weighted functions, to generate test sets with high t-wise coverage. We demonstrate that our approach reaches significantly higher t-wise coverage than uniform sampling. The novel usage of literal weighted sampling leaves open several interesting directions, empirical as well as theoretical, for future research."
