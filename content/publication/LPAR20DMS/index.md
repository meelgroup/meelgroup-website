abstract: We generalize the definition of an Induction Model given by L. Henkin (1960).
  The main goal of the paper is to study reduction and equivalence between these Induction
  Models. We give a formal definition for these concepts and then prove a criterion
  which can be used to check when one Induction Model can be reduced to or is equivalent
  to another Induction Model. We also look at the base cases and generating functions
  which can give us an Induction Model. There are three cases which we look at depending
  on the structure of the generating functions (arbitrary, additive, multiplicative).
