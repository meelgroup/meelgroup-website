abstract: 'The fundamental problem of weighted sampling involves sampling of satisfying assignments of Boolean formulas, which specify sampling sets, and according to distributions defined by pre-specified weight functions to weight functions. The tight integration of sampling routines in various applications has highlighted the need for samplers to be incremental, i.e., samplers are expected to handle updates to weight functions. 
The primary contribution of this work is an efficient knowledge compilation-based weighted sampler, INC, designed for incremental sampling. INC builds on top of the recently proposed knowledge compilation language, OBDD[AND], and is accompanied by rigorous theoretical guarantees. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that INC is faster than state-of-the-art approach for majority of the evaluation. In particular, we observed a median of 1.69X runtime improvement over the prior state-of-the-art approach.'
