abstract: Interpretability has become a central thread in ML research. As ML algorithms
  continue to permeate critical application domains such as medicine, legal, and transportation,
  it becomes increasingly important to allow human domain experts to understand and
  interact with ML solutions. ML algorithms that produce predictions in the form of
  rules are arguably some of the most interpretable ones, but their discrete combinatorial
  structure makes them computationally hard to learn. Here we generalize the widely
  popular CNF rules and introduce relaxed-CNF rules. These rules are much more flexible
  in terms of fitting data (have higher capacity) but about as interpretable to people
  as the traditional ones. We consider relaxed definitions of standard OR/AND operators
  which allow exceptions in the construction of a clause and also in the selection
  of clauses in a rule. We first describe an exact ILP solution, which is computationally
  expensive. We then propose an incremental solution, which allows us to generate
  accurate interpretable relaxed-CNF rules with significantly improved runtime performance.
