abstract: Boolean functional synthesis is a fundamental problem in computer science
  with wide-ranging applications and has witnessed a surge of interest resulting in
  progressively improved techniques over the past decade. Despite intense algorithmic
  development, a large number of problems remain beyond the reach of the state of
  the art techniques. Motivated by the progress in machine learning, we propose Manthan,
  a novel data-driven approach to Boolean functional synthesis. Manthan views functional
  synthesis as a classification problem, relying on advances in constrained sampling
  for data generation, and advances in automated reasoning for a novel proof-guided
  refinement and provable verification. On an extensive and rigorous evaluation over
  609 benchmarks, we demonstrate that Manthan significantly improves upon the current
  state of the art, solving 356 benchmarks in comparison to 280, which is the most
  solved by a state of the art technique; thereby, we demonstrate an increase of 76
  benchmarks over the current state of the art. Furthermore, Manthan solves 60 benchmarks
  that none of the current state of the art techniques could solve. The significant
  performance improvements, along with our detailed analysis, highlights several interesting
  avenues of future work at the intersection of machine learning, constrained sampling,
  and automated reasoning.
