abstract: The recent surge of interest in reasoning about probabilistic graphical
  models has led to the development of various techniques for probabilistic reasoning.
  Of these, techniques based on weighted model counting are particularly interesting
  since they can potentially leverage recent advances in unweighted model counting
  and in propositional satisfiability solving. In this paper, we present a new approach
  to weighted model counting via reduction to unweighted model counting. Our reduction,
  which is polynomial-time and preserves the normal form (CNF/DNF) of the input formula,
  allows us to exploit advances in unweighted model counting to solve weighted model
  counting instances. Experiments with weighted model counters built using our reduction
  indicate that these counters performs much better than a state-of-the-art weighted
  model counter.
