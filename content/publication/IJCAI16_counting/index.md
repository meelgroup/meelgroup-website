abstract: Probabilistic inference via model counting has emerged as a scalable technique
  with strong formal guarantees, thanks to recent advances in hashing-based approximate
  counting. State-of-the-art hashing-based counting algorithms use an {NP} oracle,
  such that the number of oracle invocations grows linearly in the number of variables
  n in the input constraint. We present a new approach to hashing-based approximate
  model counting in which the number of oracle invocations grows logarithmically in
  $n$, while still providing strong theoretical guarantees. Our experiments show that
  the new approach outperforms state-of-the-art techniques for approximate counting
  by 1-2 orders of magnitude in running time.
