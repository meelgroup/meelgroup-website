abstract: 'Modern society is increasingly reliant on the functionality of infrastructure
  facilities and utility services. Consequently, there has been surge of interest
  in the problem of quantification of system reliability, which is known to be #P-complete.
  Reliability also contributes to the resilience of systems, so as to effectively
  make them bounce back after contingencies. Despite diverse progress, most techniques
  to estimate system reliability and resilience remain computationally expensive.
  In this paper, we investigate how recent advances in hashing-based approaches to
  counting can be exploited to improve computational techniques for system reliability.
  The primary contribution of this paper is a novel framework, RelNet, that provides
  provably approximately correct (PAC) estimates for arbitrary networks. We then apply
  RelNet to ten real world power transmission grids across different cities in the
  U.S. and are able to obtain, to the best of our knowledge, the first theoretically
  sound a priori estimates of reliability between several pairs of nodes of interest.
  Such estimates will help managing uncertainty and support rational decision making
  for community resilience.'
