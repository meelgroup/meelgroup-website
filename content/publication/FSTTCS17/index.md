abstract: 'Propositional model counting is a fundamental problem in artificial intelligence
  with a wide variety of applications, such as probabilistic inference, decision making
  under uncertainty, and probabilistic databases. Consequently, the problem is of
  theoretical as well as practical interest. When the constraints are expressed as
  DNF formulas, Monte Carlo-based techniques have been shown to provide a fully polynomial
  randomized approximation scheme (FPRAS). For CNF constraints, hashing-based approximation
  techniques have been demonstrated to be highly successful. Furthermore, it was shown
  that hashing-based techniques also yield an FPRAS for DNF counting without usage
  of Monte Carlo sampling. Our analysis, however, shows that the proposed hashing-based
  approach to DNF counting provides poor time complexity compared to the Monte Carlo-based
  DNF counting techniques. Given the success of hashing-based techniques for CNF constraints,
  it is natural to ask: Can hashing-based techniques provide an efficient FPRAS for
  DNF counting? In this paper, we provide a positive answer to this question. To this
  end, we introduce two novel algorithmic techniques: Symbolic Hashing and Stochastic
  Cell Counting, along with a new hash family of Row-Echelon hash functions. These
  innovations allow us to design a hashing-based FPRAS for DNF counting of similar
  complexity as that of prior works. Furthermore, we expect these techniques to have
  potential applications beyond DNF counting.'
