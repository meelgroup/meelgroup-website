abstract: Constrained sampling and counting are two fundamental problems in artificial
  intelligence with a diverse range of applications, spanning probabilistic reasoning
  and planning to constrained-random verification. While the theory of these problems
  was thoroughly investigated in the 1980s, prior work either did not scale to industrial
  size instances or gave up correctness guarantees to achieve scalability. Recently,
  we proposed a novel approach that combines universal hashing and SAT solving and
  scales to formulas with hundreds of thousands of variables without giving up correctness
  guarantees. This paper provides an overview of the key ingredients of the approach
  and discusses challenges that need to be overcome to handle larger real-world instances.
