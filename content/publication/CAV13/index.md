abstract: Functional verification constitutes one of the most challenging tasks in
  the development of modern hardware systems, and simulation-based verification techniques
  dominate the functional verification landscape. A dominant paradigm in simulation-based
  verification is directed random testing, where a model of the system is simulated
  with a set of random test stimuli that are uniformly or near-uniformly distributed
  over the space of all stimuli satisfying a given set of constraints. Uniform or
  near-uniform generation of solutions for large constraint sets is therefore a problem
  of theoretical and practical interest. For Boolean constraints, prior work offered
  heuristic approaches with no guarantee of performance, and theoretical approaches
  with proven guarantees, but poor performance in practice. We offer here a new approach
  with theoretical performance guarantees and demonstrate its practical utility on
  large constraint sets.
