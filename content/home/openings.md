<font color="olive">We are always looking for highly motivated Ph.D. students, research assistants and summer internship for exceptional undergraduate interns in our group. We work at the intersection of algorithmic design and systems; therefore, an ideal candidate should have deeper expertise in one area and willingness to learn the other. A strong background in statistics, algorithms/formal methods and prior experience in coding is crucial to make a significant contribution to our research.

<h2> Application Procedure: </h2>

<li style=text-align:justify> If you are a student at the University of Toronto, feel free to drop by 
Kuldeep's office or schedule a meeting with him. (See <a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=meel%40comp.nus.edu.sg" target="_top">his calendar</a>). </li>

<li style=text-align:justify> Post-doc position:  We have multiple post-doc positions available. Read  <a href="files/postdoc.html">advertisement</a> for more details about the positions and application procedure. 


<li style=text-align:justify> Internship (>=6 months): We strongly prefer candidates who want to use their internship as a way to apply for PhD programs (at UofT or elsewhere; of course, if you are good, we would like you to remain at UofT). Email <a href= "mailto:meel+interns@cs.toronto.edu">meel+interns@cs.toronto.edu</a> with a PDF of your CV. Make sure your subject contains the word "olleh" and you should include reviews of two of the papers published in the previous 3 years at AAAI/IJCAI/CP/SAT/CAV conferences. The reviews should be in the body of the email (and not as pdf). Furthermore, the body of your email should contain the phrase: "Here are two papers that I have reviewed". You should also provide reason for your choice of the papers. 
</li>

<li style=text-align:justify> Short term internship (=3 months): We may offer short term internship to exceptional undergraduates. Same process as above. </li>
 
<li style=text-align:justify> PhD positions: Admissions to the Department of Computer Science at UofT are handled via a central admission procedure.</li>
</ul>
