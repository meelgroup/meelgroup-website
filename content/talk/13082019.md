title = 'We presented three papers at IJCAI-19. 1) The first paper explores the [phase transition behavior of conjunction of cardinality and XOR constraints](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~meel/Papers/ijcai19pjm.pdf). 2) The second paper describes a radically new approach to exact counting wherein we compute estimates that are [probabilistically exact](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~meel/Papers/ijcai19srsm.pdf)! 3) The third one is our invited paper on [#DNF](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~meel/Papers/ijcai19msv.pdf).'
