title = '<b> We presented three papers at [CAV 2020](http://i-cav.org/2020/). </b> <br> 1. The first paper builds on our CNF-XOR solving paradigm (BIRD) and as a result, the new versions of [ApproxMC and UniGen](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~meel/Papers/cav20-sgm.pdf) are faster than ever. <br> 2. The second paper proposes the first algorithm for [approximate MUS counting](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~meel/Papers/cav20-bm.pdf). <br> 3. The third one proposes a data-driven approach for [Boolean functional synthesis](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~meel/Papers/cav20-grm.pdf), which works at the intersection of constrained sampling, machine learning and automated reasoning.'
