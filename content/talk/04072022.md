title='<b>Our work on <a href="files/publications/ATVA22.pdf">Projected Model Counting: Beyond Independent Support</a> has been accepted to  <a href="https://atva-conference.org/2022/">ATVA 2022</a>.</b> <br> We show that we can identify a set of variables, called <em> upper bound support (UBS) </em>, that is not necessarily a subset of sampling set, and yet counting models projected on UBS guarantees an upper bound of the projected model count. <br> Authors: Jiong Yang, Supratik Chakraborty, and Kuldeep S.
