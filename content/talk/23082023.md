title='<b>We will present our paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15693" target="_blank">Solving the Identifying Code Set Problem with Grouped Independent Support</a> this month at <a href="https://ijcai-23.org/" target="_blank">IJCAI 2023</a>.</b><br>We show how reducing an NP-hard problem to a problem in the second order of the polynomial hierarchy helps us to exponentially decrease the encoding size. By leveraging modern solvers that solve problems beyond NP, we can solve much larger problem instances than the former state of the art.<br>If you are attending IJCAI in Macau, please come to our talk on <b>Wednesday 23rd August, at 11:45am</b> in the <i>CSO: Constraint Programming</i> session, or join us for the poster session afterwards, from 5pm until 6:30pm.
