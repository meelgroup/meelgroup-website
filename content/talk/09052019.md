title = 'Two papers accepted to IJCAI. The first paper explores the phase transition behavior of conjunction of cardinality and XOR constraints. Authors: Yash Pote, Saurabh Joshi, Kuldeep Meel.<br> The second paper describes a radically new approach to exact counting wherein we compute estimates that are probabilistically exact! Authors: Shubham Sharma, Kuldeep Meel. Combined with our invited paper on <a href= "https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~meel/Papers/CP2018msv.pdf"> #DNF</a>, this makes 3 papers that we will be presenting at IJCAI.'
